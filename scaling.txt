I think the easiest way to scale this project would be to use as a simple webapp.
Since we can edit the data being used in our json file we can train this to be used
on most any website. From here we make the flask templating, get the app trained.
We can then take user input from the webapp and use it to talk to our model. Then 
we return the results to the user. Since chatbots are so dymanic this app could also
be hosted on a server and used to run bots in severs for either slack or discord.
With NLP the possibilities are endless for apps!
